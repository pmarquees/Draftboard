# Draftboard

**Draftboard** is a shared space for teams to post designs, ideas, and work in progress. In distributed teams, meaningful work too often disappears into Slack threads or gets buried inside Figma, making it harder to learn from each other and keep ideas flowing. Draftboard brings that work back into the open with a lightweight, social feed that’s easy to deploy, pleasant to use, and flexible enough to fit into existing workflows.

## Features

- **Feed** — Reverse chronological feed of posts with list and grid views
- **Rich Editor** — Lexical-based editor with markdown shortcuts, @mentions, slash commands, drag-and-drop, pasting and automatic draft saving.
- **Attachments** — Images, videos, files, Figma links, and Loom recordings with a carousel viewer
- **Projects** — Organize posts into projects with cover images, descriptions, and team members
- **Comments** — Threaded comments with 2 levels of depth and attachment-specific comments
- **Reactions** — Like, wow, cool reactions plus custom emoji support
- **Notifications** — Notifications for comments, replies, mentions, and reactions
- **Search** — Full-text search across posts, projects, and people
- **Webhooks** — Optional Discord and Slack webhook integrations for new posts
- **Admin** — User management, invite links, and site settings
- **Dark Mode** — Full light/dark theme support
- **Mobile PWA** — Fully mobile-optimized as a Progressive Web App, feels at home on iOS and Android home screens

## Ackgnowledgements

This tool stands on the shoulders of earlier tools like [Pixelcloud](https://engineering.fb.com/2011/02/15/web/hackathon-22-redesigning-pixelcloud/) and [Campsite](https://www.campsite.com/), which helped shape many of the ideas explored here. I’ve been fortunate to work closely with both—contributing to Pixelcloud during my time at Facebook and supporting Campsite as an investor—and this project carries forward lessons learned from each.
